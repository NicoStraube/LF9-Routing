# LF9-routing-demo
## Description
A simple routing demo for the LF9 compartment.
Here we visualize how routing works and how we can interact with it.

## Requirements
- [Filius](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/Herunterladen)
- OS that can run Filius

## What is Filius?
Filius is a free and open source software for the design of network infrastructure.
There you can create a network topology and simulate the network behavior in livetime.
Whilte the simulation is running you can also interact with each network element and change some configurations or access the emulated desktop's of each node/pc/laptop.

## Stuff
1. Install Filius
2. Open Filius
3. Create a new project
5. Create a Topology
6. Start the simulation


## Rules
- No dynamic routing
- Only static routing
